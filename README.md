# FDM Game Controller
This is just a really badly made program that allows you to control the main aspectsd of a Marlin FDM 3D printer with an XBOX controller. Other gamepads may work, yet I have not tested them. Feel free to download and use this project, however I do not plan to maintain it. If any weird or dangerous bugs appear let me know, I will probably fix them eventually.
